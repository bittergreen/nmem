# About
This repository is mainly for my personal interest of understanding neural memory.

First I'll implement some related architectures that's interesting, and then try to innovate
and make new stuff out of those basic models.

# Contents

## 1.Variational Autoencoders(VAE): 
Based on the code of [MIT CS 6.s191](http://introtodeeplearning.com), Lecture 4 & Lab2 pt2.
I re-implemented it with pytorch. (/vae)

## 2.Hopfield Network: 

Learning from [Artem Kirsanov's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WPJdAW-sFo).

## 3.Boltzman Machine(waiting for Artem Kirsanov to make a new videoâ€¦lol)

## 4.Modern Hopfield Nets(Also as a layer in pytorch)

[paper](https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/#selfatt)

## 5.Diffusion Models
